# cornerstone-mpr

## FYI: This project was created as a learning exercise, and is not really functional as an MPR viewer. It uses a probably very wrong approach to creating reconstructions, but was fun nonetheless.

Do arbitrary oblique multiplanar reconstructions in the browser without webGL.

Uses Bresenham algorithm for computing slab pixel coordinates.

Uses Three.js for math utilities only, not for rendering or webGL. Uses Vector3, Plane, Quaternion
and Line3.
